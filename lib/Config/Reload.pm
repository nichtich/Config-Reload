=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $config = Config::Reload->new(
        wait => 60,     # check at most every minute (default)
        ...             # passed to Config::ZOMG, e.g. file => $filename
    );

    my $config = $config->load;

    sleep(60);

    $config = $config->load;   # reloaded

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl package loads config files via L<Config::ZOMG> which is based on
L<Config::Any>. Configuration is reloaded on file changes (based on file names
and last modification time).

This package is highly experimental and not fully covered by unit tests!

=method new

Returns a new C<Config::Reload> object.  All arguments but C<wait>, C<error>
and C<checked> are passed to the constructor of L<Config::ZOMG>.

=method load

Get the configuration, possibly (re)loading configuration files. Always returns
a hash reference, on error this C< { } >.

=method wait

Get or set the number of seconds to wait between checking. Set to 60 (one
minute) by default.

=method checked

Returns a timestamp of last time files had been checked.

=method loaded

Returns a timestamp of last time files had been loaded. Returns C<undef> before
first loading and on error.

=method found

Returns a list of files that configuration has been loaded from.

=method find

Returns a list of files that configuration will be loaded from on next check.
Files will be reloaded only if C<files_hash> value of of C<find> differs from
the value of C<found>:

    use Config::Reload qw(files_hash);

    files_hash( $config->find ) ne files_hash( $config->found )

=method error

Returns an error message if loading failed. As long as an error is set, the
C<load> method returns an empty hash reference until the next attempt to reload
(typically the time span defind with C<wait>).  One can manually unset the
error with C<< $c->error(undef) >> to force reloading.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 files_hash( @files )

Returns a hexadecimal MD5 value based on names, -sizes and modification times
of a list of files. Internally used to compare C<find> and C<found>.

This function can be exported on request.
